# User Workspace

## Project Overview

User Workspace is a Node.js application designed to provide a backend workspace for user interactions and handling various functionalities, including authentication, data handling, and more. This project leverages several popular Node.js libraries to simplify the development process and ensure robustness.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js (v18+) installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   Use the following command to run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API endpoints defined in the application. You can make requests to the server using any API client like Postman or your web browser. Ensure that you follow the API documentation (if available) for specific endpoints, their methods, and expected payload.

## Features

- User authentication via JWT
- File parsing support (PDF and CSV)
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- CORS support for cross-domain requests
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Mongoose for MongoDB interactions

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies as outlined in `package.json`:

- `bcrypt`: Password hashing library
- `body-parser`: Middleware for parsing request bodies
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling CORS
- `express`: Web framework for Node.js
- `jsonwebtoken`: Library for encoding and decoding JWTs
- `mongoose`: ODM library for MongoDB
- `papaparse`: CSV parsing library
- `pdf-parse`: PDF parsing library
- `socket.io`: Library for real-time web applications

### Additional Note on Dependencies
To ensure that the project works correctly, make sure to have the appropriate version of Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed, as specified in the dependencies of some libraries.
